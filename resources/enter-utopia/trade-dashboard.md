Utopia’s trade dashboard was created with one thing in mind. The User. Through the dashboard you’ll have a complete overview of all data associated with your vaults accompanied by user-friendly functionalities and easy to understand visual graphs representing each vault.

View the vault's EAT (Estimated Annual Target), Vault popularity, Vault assets and Vault Categories quickly through its simplified overview, with the ‘Expert Mode’ diving deeper into those who want all the ins and outs! We created the EAT (Estimated Annual Target) to simplify APY’s for our users, rather than the user having to calculate the projections for each manually, we do it for you, giving you an easy to understand projection of the annual target for the vault token.
